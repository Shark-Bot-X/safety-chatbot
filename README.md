## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### User Workflow

1. **Start Conversation**: User describes the incident naturally
2. **Data Extraction**: System automatically extracts relevant information
3. **Follow-up Questions**: Bot asks for missing required fields
4. **AI Enhancement**: Groq AI makes responses natural and friendly
5. **Validation**: UEBA system analyzes input quality
6. **Submission**: Report is saved to Google Sheets
7. **Confirmation**: User receives submission confirmation

### Example Interaction

```
Bot: Welcome to the Vehicle Safety Reporting System. Please describe the incident.

User: My 2022 Toyota Camry had brake failure in Los Angeles yesterday at 60 mph

Bot: Thank you for that information. I've recorded the vehicle details (Toyota Camry, 2022) 
     and location (Los Angeles). Was there a crash? (Yes/No)

User: No, but it was scary

Bot: Understood. Were there any injuries? (Enter number)

User: 0

Bot: Got it. Please describe exactly what happened.
```

## Architecture

### Flow Diagram

```
User Input → UEBA Analysis → Data Extraction → AI Response Generation
                                    ↓
                              Missing Fields?

                           Yes → Ask Next Question
                           No  → Save to Google Sheets → Confirmation
```

### Key Components

#### `generate_friendly_reply()`
Calls Groq API to transform structured messages into natural conversation

#### `analyze_user_behavior()`
Scores input based on length, formatting, and content patterns

#### `ComplaintBot.extract_data()`
Uses regex and pattern matching to extract structured data from free text

#### `save_to_google_sheet()`
Authenticates and appends report data to Google Sheets
